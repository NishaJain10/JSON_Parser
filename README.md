# JSON Parser 

## Objective

The core objective of our project is to automate the process of parsing JSON data, thereby enhancing efficiency, reliability, and maintainability in software development workflows. By leveraging Flex and Bison, we create a robust parser capable of breaking down input JSON text into tokens and constructing a parse tree based on the defined syntax rules and grammar. This parser serves as a fundamental building block for developers, enabling them to seamlessly integrate JSON parsing capabilities into their applications.

## Technologies Used

We utilize Flex (Lexical Analyzer Generator) to tokenize the input JSON text and Bison (Parser Generator) to define the grammar rules and parse the token stream. The parser checks the syntax of the JSON input and identifies any errors, such as mismatched braces or incorrect key-value pairs. Additionally, it constructs a parse tree, which can be further utilized for various applications, such as data validation, manipulation, or conversion.

## Implementation Details

The Flex (.l) file defines lexical rules and tokenizes the input JSON text, recognizing patterns such as strings, integers, booleans, and whitespace. On the other hand, the Bison (.y) file specifies grammar rules for parsing JSON objects, including keys, values, arrays, and nested structures. Semantic actions embedded within the Bison file generate output based on the parsed input, facilitating the construction of a parse tree representing the hierarchical structure of the JSON data.

## Features

Our JSON parser goes beyond basic parsing functionality by incorporating error handling mechanisms to detect syntax errors, mismatches, and violations of JSON specifications. Additionally, it performs validation checks to ensure data integrity, such as verifying the uniqueness of identifiers and enforcing constraints on text length and format. These features contribute to the robustness and reliability of the parser, mitigating the risk of runtime errors and data inconsistencies.

## Extensibility and Customization

Moreover, our JSON parser is designed with extensibility and flexibility in mind, allowing developers to customize and extend its functionality to suit their specific requirements. Whether it's integrating additional JSON features, implementing custom validation rules, or adapting to evolving data formats, our parser provides a solid foundation for building sophisticated data processing pipelines.
